Let this quote from the Alchemist always be a reminder to us all that the strongest power we hold inside us is "love", it makes us human, it makes us whole and together with our combined love we can accomplish anything.

“When we love, we always strive to become better than we are. When we strive to become better than we are, everything around us becomes better too.”
― Paulo Coelho, The Alchemist
